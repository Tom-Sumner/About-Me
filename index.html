                    As a self-taught developer, I'm passionate about creating software that is both effective and user-friendly. Over the years, I've honed my skills by working on a variety of projects, including web applications, Discord bots, and even a Minecraft Java Mod. You can check out some of my work on my <a href="https://github.com/Tom-Sumner">Github page</a>.

                    I have experience in: Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
                    <br>
                    Regarding my cybersecurity experience, I have discovered and helped fix several vulnerabilities within my current school system. Including breaking into a staff intranet, gaining access to boot scripts, and finding insecure invoices. All of these were reported instantly and I took part in patching any more bugs I could find.
                    <br>
                    My language of choice in most cases is Python, however if others are needed I am always looking to learn and pick up new things.

                    <br>
                    Django has been a massive help to my programming career, giving me a way to create intricate projects by combining my Python knowledge and my web design skills into one.
                    <br>
                    I have created several products using Django, such as: A company intranet with a login page, daily news briefings and notification for messages or meetings. A farm management system, which allows employees of the farm to view all the animals, their corresponding information, log births, deaths and vet visits.
